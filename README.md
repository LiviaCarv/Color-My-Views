# Color My Views App

This application, developed as the third project during the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course at Udacity, aims to put in practice element positioning and chains on ConstraintLayout.

# Overview

The app allows users to color different geometric shapes by tapping on them. 
Additionally, a customized text is displayed to the user based on the Views they interact with.
